## PHATO: Phishing Attack Ontology

PHATO is a well-founded Phishing Attack Ontology, specified in OntoUML modeling language, built by reusing the [Reference Ontology for Security Engineering](https://github.com/unibz-core/security-ontology).

The acronym plays with two related ideas: in Portuguese, ''phato'' may sound like ''fato'' (_fact_, in English) or like ''pato'' (_duck_). Phishing involves lying about the facts to deceive a target. Moreover, ''pato'' is slang meaning a naive person who is easily deceived.

## Project Structure

* [/ontouml](/ontouml) contains files related to the conceptual version of PHATO, which is represented in OntoUML.

## Reusing .vpp files

* To open and edit .vpp files, use [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com)

## Built with

* [Visual Paradigm](https://www.visual-paradigm.com) - a UML CASE tool that offers a [free community edition version](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp)
* The [OntoUML Plugin](https://github.com/OntoUML/ontouml-vp-plugin) for Visual Paradigm
